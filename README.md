## From Author
The project *EnePro* is derived from my homework of programming, when I was a 2nd-year undergraduate student.
The 1st version of *EnePro* was written by **C++**, and the functions were limitted, but that was my first program.
Recently, I re-wrote the *EnePro* with **Python**, added more functions, and it become more flexible.
Hope you enjoy this program. If you have find any bugs, please let me know. Thanks:)
